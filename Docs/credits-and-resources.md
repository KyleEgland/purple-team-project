# Purple Team Project - credits and resources

This project (if it reallizes *any* level of its potential) will be a lot of pointers to the works of others. This first itteration (what you're currently reading) is my first attempt at *something*. We should certainly make this better in the future and this *definitely* needs to be an immediate "feature number 2" for the project. Everyone should see the people/projects/resources that made this possible and lead to our collective education.

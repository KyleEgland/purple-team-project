# Purple Team Project - Sync Log

Life is messy and not everything can be planned for. This document is to help keeping up-to-date with each sync and project current direction.

## To do

- Project 1: Broweser Fingerprinting
  - site/project init
  - "basic browser fingerprinting"

## Misc

28-Feb-2021
- `_data`, `_drafts`, and `_posts` were empty upon initial push to Github and were therefore *not* synced.

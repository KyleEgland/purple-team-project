<h2>5-Ws (and an H) Series - Purple Team Edition</h2>

<p>Solving a problem is a stressful task, or, at least, it can be. Often times, a simple frame work for keeping us on-task is enough to make the efforts of problem solving more focused and quickly yield fruit. Therefore, I will be working to apply the 5-W's (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) along with the How explained along the way. The idea is to learn about development while maintaining a sense of security (what do the things we can do that the "bad guys" can also do?). It's also important to be informed as a user (what do businesses/other people know about me from my web usage?).</p>
